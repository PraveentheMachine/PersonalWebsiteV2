# PersonalWebsiteV2

This is the second iteration of my website, I have retired "praveenbandarage.me" and migrated to https://www.praveenbandarage.com/ I have utilised Vercel and setup CI such that once I commit to master it will auto update website which is a neat feature.

### What I used

To build out my website I used plain old HTML and CSS with a bit of TailwindCSS to make it fully responsive. 



### Things to add (after Tri 1)
